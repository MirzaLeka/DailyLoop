## **Daily Loop**

#### *App info*:

Daily Loop is a productivity To-Do list application for managing daily tasks.Â 
It all starts with user authentication, followed by an email notification. Users can list everything they want to do and from that point they can update description of each todo, title and complete status. They can delete todos, search for todos and even filter the results.

The goal of this project me was to get familiar with working with Mongo DB, performing CRUD operations and JWT authentication,
but I'm having so much fun that I decided to go the extra mile and build a practical Todo application.

**Frontend** is done from scratch: no templates, plugins, or third-party snippets. 
**Design** is also custom-made. I looked at other to-do apps and tried to create something new yet familiar.

Most of the **Backend** is done while following *Andrew Mead's* [Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) Udemy course. 
As I studied, I sometimes went off the course path, read the docs on my own and created features like saerch bar, search filter any many more that are yet to be revealed.
